# recipeApp
 This project is a website that allows users to store and organize their favorite recipes. Users can add new recipes to the website, which are stored in a database. They can also browse and search through existing recipes to find something to cook.

In addition to storing and browsing recipes, the website includes a feature that allows users to plan their grocery lists based on the recipes they want to make. This feature pulls the ingredients needed for each recipe and organizes them into a list that can be printed or viewed on a mobile device for easy shopping.

The website also includes a feature that allows users to track the expiration dates of their groceries. Users can enter the items they have purchased and the website will track the expiration date, displaying a reminder to the user when it is approaching.

Finally, the website will provide an overview of the calorie count of each recipe and ingredient to help users make informed choices when planning their meals. This project is still in progress.
